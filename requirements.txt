# Requirements for Face_Verification (notebook + Jetson/DeepFace helpers)
# Notes:
# - TensorRT is provided by the Jetson system (do NOT install via pip). This file
#   lists Python packages used by the notebook and helpers (DeepFace, ONNX tooling, PyCUDA).
# - On Jetson Nano prefer using the system's OpenCV/TensorFlow packages; some pip wheels
#   may not be compatible with Jetson's ARM platform.

# Core ML / numeric libs
numpy>=1.19
scipy

# Deep learning (keep broad; pin if you need reproducible envs)
tensorflow>=2.0

# Computer vision / image IO
opencv-python
Pillow

# Notebook / plotting / utilities
matplotlib
ipython
scikit-learn

# DeepFace for gender/face attribute analysis
deepface

# ONNX / conversion / runtime (used when exporting to ONNX and building TRT engine)
tf2onnx
onnx
onnxruntime


# NOTE: `pycuda` and other CUDA-dependent packages are NOT portable to macOS
# (they require NVIDIA CUDA headers and libraries). If you are developing on macOS
# keep this file as-is (without pycuda). For deployment on a Jetson Nano, use
# `requirements-jetson.txt` which includes pycuda and other Jetson-specific items.

# Optional: if running in Google Colab, the notebook uses some Colab helpers (optional)
# google-colab
