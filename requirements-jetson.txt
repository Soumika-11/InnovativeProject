# Jetson-specific Python requirements
# Build/install these on the Jetson device (ARM64, with CUDA & TensorRT installed).
# Note: TensorRT is provided by the Jetson SDK and should NOT be installed via pip.

numpy
scipy
opencv-python
Pillow
matplotlib
ipython
scikit-learn

# DeepFace (may pull heavy TF deps)
deepface

# ONNX conversion/runtime
tf2onnx
onnx
onnxruntime

# PyCUDA: requires CUDA toolkit headers & libraries present on the device
pycuda

# Optional (only if you plan to run conversion on the Jetson itself)
# tf2onnx may be slow on Jetson Nano; you can convert on a workstation instead.
